## Datasets
We open sourced our simulated datasets **VCTK-Token**.

**Download link will be attached soon.**

## Environment configuration
Please refer [environment.yml](environment.yml)

If you have Miniconda/Anaconda installed, you can directly use the command: `conda env create -f environment.yml`


## Inference
We opensourced our inference code and checkpoints, here are the steps to perform inference:

0. Clone this repository.
  
1. Download [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14N8-ax3DOxJc64PvrHrv4jHNwCI5u3_o?usp=sharing), create a folder named `pretrained`, and put all downloaded models into it.
   
2. We also provide testing datasets for quick inference, download it [here](). Put the folder `testingset` at the same level as `inference.ipynb`.
   
3. Run `inference.ipynb` to perform inference step by step.
